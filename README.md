# Running Performance Visualizer

A web application to visualize athlete performance data from [Power of 10](https://www.thepowerof10.info).

## TODO

- implement search by name
- show more parkrun stats (top parkruns, PB by venue)
- optimize for mobile
- more user-friendly (error handling, spinner, etc)
- implement athlete comparison
